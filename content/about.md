description: 'A quick blurb about myself'
---

Hi, I'm a **Seattle-based front-end developer and
designer.** I love focusing on the web specifically as it
allows for **more creative freedom** and **accessibility** by
being platform agnostic. Typically I like to play a role
in the design phase when starting a new project,
planning out the **themes, design language, and layout**, as
well as building out the website or web app's **skeleton
and its internal components**. My background is in **illustration** and
**graphic design**, and later
studied **full-stack web development** at General Assembly,
a popular code bootcamp in Seattle. I'm **always open to
new projects**, so if you stumble across this page feel
free to email me at <span class="hover:underline text-purple-700"><info@tannerkovach.com><span>.
